Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
	
	A:Programmers use pseudocode to help develop algorithms and to focus on the logic
	rather than the details of language syntax. Using pseudocode, you break the code
	into parts and describe each step, creating an outline.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
	
	A: Nothing, pseudocode isn't a code meant for comouters, but for humans to read.

Programming Assignment

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
	
	INPUT two numbers
	IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
		PRINT first number
	ELSE 
		PRINT second number
	END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100

	SET number to 1
	WHILE number is less than or equal to 100
		PRINT number + 1
	END WHILE

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook

	INPUT first name, last name and phonebook 
	IF the first and last name is the same as the contact in the phonebook
		PRINT contact information
	END IF

4. Using the Pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement 
it in any computer language of your choice.

function findEntry(firstName, lastName, phoneBook){
     for(let i = 0; i < phoneBook.length; i++){
      if(firstName === phoneBook[i].firstName && lastName === phoneBook[i].lastName){
      return `${phoneBook[i].firstName} ${phoneBook[i].lastName}`;
    }
  }
    return 'Contact not found'
}

console.log(findEntry("Kelly", "Smith", [{firstName:"John", lastName:"Smith"}, {firstName:"Kelly", lastName:"Smith"}]))
