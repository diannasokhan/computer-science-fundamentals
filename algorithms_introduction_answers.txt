1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

-Making coffee
  Get mug from cabinet.
  Get coffee ground bag from cabinet
  Place two tablespoons of coffee into a coffee filter
  Put the filter in the coffee machine
  Turn on coffee machine
  Press brew
    Wait
  Pour coffee into mug

-Washing dishes
  Wet sponge
  Put dish soap onto sponge
  Lather sponge
  Scrub dirty plates
  Rinse
  Place clean plates on dish rack
 
-Brushing teeth
  Rinse toothbrush
  Put toothpaste onto toothbrush
  Brush teeth
  Brush tongue
  Clean toothbrush
  Put toothbrush away
  Rinse mouth

2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. 
It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies 
who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It 
doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's 
algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your 
cases make them stand out?

-Waze's map app: Waze accurately tells you how long it will take to get to your destination, while
also letting you know when you are driving too fast and if there are police around.

-Apple's Siri: You are able to activate Siri with your voice and she can do almost anything from calling
somebody to searching up information on the web.

-LinkedIn Website: Allows you to find jobs and connect with actual people that work in the company.

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

The instructions should be a sequence of logical steps that accomplish a goal and finish in a finite amount of time.
