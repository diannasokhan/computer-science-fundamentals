Exercises

1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

	A: Searching your car in a parking garage after you forgot where you parked it.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

	A: Searching for a word in the dictionary.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find 
the value G using linear search?

	A: 7 iterations.

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find 
the value G using binary search?

	A: 3

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? 
Explain your reasoning.

	A: Linear because binary search only works with sorted collections.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

	A: Binary search would be more useful. We would be able to compare the desired value with the middle value of the list. If the given value is
	greater than the value we just looked at we know that its going to be in the bottom half of the list and vice versa. This would be a lot faster than
	going through a whole list one by one.

Programming Assignment

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

function findWord(array, word){
  let low = 0;
  let high = array.length - 1;
  while(low <= high){
    let mid = (low + high)/2; 
    if(array[mid] > word){
        high = mid - 1;
    }else if(array[mid] < word){
        low = mid + 1;
      }
    else{
      return array[mid];
    }
  }
   return 'Not Found';
}

var array = ['Act', 'Albatross', 'Bitter', 'Dialect', 'Exquisite', 'Farewell', 'Lemon'];
console.log(findWord(array, 'Albatross'))

2.You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. 
Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

function getFish(tank, target){
  for(let i = 0; i < tank.length; i++){
    if(tank[i] === target){
      return 'Fish Caught';
    }
  }
  return 'Try Again'
}
var tank = ['Goldfish', 'Pink-spotted Goldfish', 'Yellow-spotted Goldfish', 'White-spotted Goldfish'];

console.log(getFish(tank, 'White-spotted Goldfish'))
